## This is a repository for the implementation of the algorithm described in "P3,5P: Estimation with Unknown Focal Length" by Changchang Wu

The final function is called p35p_solver() and can be found in the corresponding file.

There is also a script that runs this function on generated data: tests\p35p_on_gen.m

In main.m is the previous form of the algorithm not contained in one function and without filtration but it still findes the solution.
