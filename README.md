# Fast localisation of uncalibrated cameras

This is a repository for the implementation of the algorithm described in "P3,5P: Estimation with Unknown Focal Length" by Changchang Wu
and "Efficient Intersection of Three Quadrics and Applications in Computer Vision" by Zuzana Kukelova and others.
It was done as a part of bachelor's thesis "Fast localisation of uncalibrated cameras".

To test functions run:
```
codegen_templates/test_all.m
```

To generate mex functions from MATLAB functions using MATLAB Coder use project `codegen_templates/pnpf.prj`
